# Meair Chat
Meair chat is a android based instant messaging service for smartphone that uses internet for communication.
In addition to text messaging, users can also send graphical emoticons, images, videos, files like PDF, DOCX file.

The App registration uses standard one-time-password (OTP) based authentication process. With abundance of low-cost data, Meair Chat application decides to go from a single super app strategy to multiple app approach, so it can focus on the core messaging capabilities.
